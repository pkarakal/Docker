# A Docker image for providing a unified computing system for coursework

## Installation of the CSAL Docker image

Note: This README assumes that there is already Docker installed on the host machine, either Windows, MacOS or Linux. For more info on how to obtain Docker, please visit:

https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop

Start by downloading the content of this repo, either through `git clone https://github.com/AUTh-csal/Docker.git` or by zip download here:
 
https://github.com/AUTh-csal/Docker/archive/main.zip 

Afterwards, by opening a terminal or Command Prompt, according to your host OS, navigate to the folder where the extracted data is (default extracted folder is `Docker`). There you can see the following directory structure (timestamps may vary!):

```
2020-09-29  08:57    <DIR>          .
2020-09-29  08:57    <DIR>          ..
2020-10-07  15:12             3Â 703 Dockerfile
2020-09-29  08:57                47 hpc-build-image
2020-09-29  08:57                85 hpc-create-container
2020-09-29  08:57                89 hpc-start-container
2020-09-29  08:57                78 hpc-uninstall
2020-09-29  08:57               786 Welcome
2020-09-29  08:57    <DIR>          Windows
```
For Windows users, navigate to the `Windows` directory and then run `hpc-build-image.bat`, `hpc-create-container.bat` and `hpc-start-container.bat`. The screenshots below show the expected behavior respectively (folder names may vary, I have used `c:\git\Docker2` as my base folder).

![hpc-create-container](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16119641/95837999-8cba7f80-0d41-11eb-9af9-5e94f56f3ceb.png)

![hpc-start-container](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16119641/95838179-c25f6880-0d41-11eb-82e7-40ef30f7ccb5.png)

For Linux and MacOS users, remain in this folder, run `hpc-build-image`, `hpc-create-container` and `hpc-start-container`.

## Pulling & building hello world examples for the course 050 - Parallel & Distributed Systems

After succesfully having built, created and ran the container, you should be able to see the following screen, aka `welcome screen`.

Then you can clone our `pds-codebase` repo by envoking the command `git clone https://github.com/AUTh-csal/pds-codebase.git` inside the container, as shown in the screenshow below.

Then you can `cd` into the new folder by `cd pds-codebase` and do a `make all` and `make test` and you should be able to build all the hello world examples and run their respective tests as show below.

## Use Vagrant VM
Vagrant enables users to create and configure lightweight, reproducible, and portable development environments. This is 
a bit more heavy than a docker container but can be quite useful for users that either can't run docker or that really 
have encountered serious problems with the docker setup. Vagrant creates a VM with the configuration on the Vagrantfile

### To be up and running
This Vagrant Box can either run with the VirtualBox hypervisor or the Hyper-V hypervisor. On Windows you can just enable Hyper-V.
*  Install [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads) and [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) on your system. 
    ```console
    sudo apt-get install vagrant virtualbox // Debian/Ubuntu based
    sudo dnf install vagrant VirtualBox // Fedora/CentOS/RHEL and derivatives
    ```
*  Run `vagrant up` from the directory of this repository
*  SSH to the vagrant box by running `vagrant ssh`
*  To shutdown the VM just run `vagran hault`
